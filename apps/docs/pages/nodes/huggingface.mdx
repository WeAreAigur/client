## Name
`hf`

## Description

The `hf` helper lets you use any Hugging Face model. It receives a callback that is passed a `HfInference` object with all the Hugging Face tasks as properties. The callback returns the HuggingFace task you want to execute. The `hf` will take the task and create an Aigur node around it.
The input and output will then be appropriately typed.

## Example

```ts index.ts
import { hf } from '@aigur/client';
//...
flow.node(
  hf(hf => hf.questionAnswer),
  ({ input }) => ({
    model: 'deepset/roberta-base-squad2',
    inputs: {
      question: 'What is the capital of France?',
      context: 'The capital of France is Paris.',
    },
  })
)
.output(({ prev }) => ({
  capital: prev.answer, // <-- "capital" is the Pipeline's output field
}))
```


## Input
 
 The input depends on the task you are using.

## Output
 
 The output depends on the task you are using.
