## Path
`flow.text.prediction.gpt3Stream`

## Description

Calls GPT3 and returns the result as a [Stream](/streaming)

## API Key

Uses the `openai` API key:

```ts index.ts
const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
})
```

## Example

```ts index.ts
//...
flow.text.prediction.gpt3Stream(() => ({
  prompt: 'Hello, how are you?'
})) // --> ReadableStream
```

## Output

The output of this Node is not an `object`, rather a `ReadableStream`.
